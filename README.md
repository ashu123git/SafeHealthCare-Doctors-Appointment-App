# SafeHealthCare-Doctors-Appointment-App

Welcome to Safe Health Care Doctor's appointment application. This is a basic Docotrs appointment system, where you as a user can register and login and book appointment and many other features.

#### USER LOGIN ####
Suppose you are new to this application. Then you see a login screen as a first screen in front of you. You won't be able to login as you are not a registered user in the database.
Please register by clicking on the Register Button and then you will be redirected to login page again to login with your new credentials. Now you will see a User's perspective UI
from where you can do the following things:-

        1> UPDATE YOUR PROFILE:- You can update your name and email address and that will be updated realtime so when you refresh the page, it will show your updated name and also 
        when you re login.
        
        2> BOOK APPOINTMENT:- You can book your appointment with a list of Doctors available at your homepage. Please click on Check Availability button to see whether the Doctor is available
        or not. If the doctor is available, only then you will be able to book the appointment.
        
        3> APPLY FOR DOCTOR:- You can also apply for a doctor if you want to become a doctor. Process is Simple. You will click on the apply doctor button. Fill Out the form. And click on Submit.
        This request will go to ADMIN for approval, once admin approves, you will become the doctor and next time you login, you will see the doctor's UI.

#### ADMIN PAGE ####
Admin Credentials: 
UserID = admin@admin.com
Password = 1234567
Now once you login as admin, then you will be able to perform below multiple things:

        1> SEE NOTIFICATIONS:- You will be able to see the notifications by clicking on the bell icon on the top right corner of your screen. There you will get notifications like approval for a doctor
        or when a new user registers.
        
        2> SEE USERS AND DOCTORS:- You will get a button by clicking on which you will be able to see list of doctors that are avilable in which you can either Reject them or Approve them. If you reject them,
        then they will not become the doctor, and if they are already a doctor, there doctor's account will be disabled. If you approve them, the respective user will again become a doctor

#### DOCTOR PAGE ####
Once the admin approves your doctor request, you will have to login again using your same credentials. Then you will see the Doctor's UI. In this new UI, You will get a Welcome page and Congratulations page.
where all the details will be present like what are the things you can do and what are not. So I am not mentioning it here.

These are some Test Doctors that I created. So In case you want to perform the testing or see the Doctor's view, below are the details:-
UserID = test@user.com              UserID = ashu@234.com
Password = 1234567                  Password = ashu@234.com



OUT OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED FEATURES, THERE ARE MANY OTHER FEATURES THAT I AM CURRENTLY DEVELOPING. SO FEEL FREE TO PUT YOUR THOUGHTS. AND I WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GET MULTIPLE BUGS IN MY APP.
SO PLEASE REACH OUT TO ME IF YOU FIND ANY. I WILL FIX IT.
